# Alzheimer-Detection-using-Medical-Image-Classification-with-Deep-Learning
Deep learning-based classification of Alzheimerâ€™s disease stages using MRI images. Includes EDA, data preprocessing, and model preparation.

This project focuses on the classification of Alzheimer's disease stages using deep learning techniques applied to medical images (likely MRI scans).

##  Objectives
- Load and preprocess the Alzheimer dataset
- Visualize class distributions and dataset structure
- Use TensorFlow and image generators for training
- Classify different stages: CN, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, AD

##  Content
- `exploration.ipynb`: Initial exploration and preparation of the dataset
- Class mapping:
  - CN: Cognitively Normal
  - EMCI: Early Mild Cognitive Impairment
  - MCI: Mild Cognitive Impairment
  - LMCI: Late Mild Cognitive Impairment
  - AD: Alzheimerâ€™s Disease

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation

## Status
Work in progress â€“ EDA and image preprocessing complete, model training in progress.
